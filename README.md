`pausa` is a small set of utilities to help you manage data fetching and caching in React using Suspense.

Heavily inspired by [Brian's](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn) work in [Suspense](https://github.com/bvaughn/suspense)

## Installation

```bash
npm install pausa
```

```bash
pnpm install pausa
```
